# Fly_ESC_with_stm32F051
ESC for brushless motors.


Driven by impulse 1-2ms.
Powered by li-ion 2S batteries.
Gives the time of passage of 2 magnets in UART. If you have 12/14 then 60/({you time} * 7) prm.
You can set the direction of rotation.

I did not debug work from 3S. May be necessary to change the voltage divider.

This board is one sided for DIY PCB home print !!!
